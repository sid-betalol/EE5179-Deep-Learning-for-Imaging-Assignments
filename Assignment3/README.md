# Assignment 3: RNNs for MNIST Digit Classification and Binary String Addition
## Task-1: RNNs for MNIST Digit Classification:
- Compared performance in terms of accuracy and speed for uni-directional and bi-directional RNN, GRU, and LSTM respectively.
- Used the model to make predictions on custom handwritten digits and validated good performance on the custom images as well.

## Take-2: Teaching an LSTM to add two binary strings
- Designed a script to generate pairs of strings and the corresponding addition result
- Evaluated bitwise accuracy using both MSE and Cross ENtropy loss functions with different hidden state sizes for various string lengths.
