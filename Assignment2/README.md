# Assignment-2: CNNs, Occlusion Experiments, and Adversarial Attacks
- Used CNNs for the classifications task on MNIST digits.
- Compared performance with 4 optimizers (SGD, Momentum, RMSProp, Adam), with and without Batch Normalization.
- Evaluated the performance of the model under occlusion with different filter sizes.
- Generated adversarial examples for non-targeted and targeted attacks using the NN.
